NoSQL means Not Only SQL, which uses other languages as well along with SQL.

Types of NoSQL :
1. Key Value [X] -Famous implementation of Key-value is redis.
2. Document Database [X] -mongoDB
3. Tabular [X] -Cassandra, Open Source database in which anyone can contribute and was built by Facebook and is mainly used by the same.
4. Graph - Coming Soon! -neo4j

Why NoSQL is needed?
NoSQL databases store data in a single data format, including a JSON document, rather than the traditional table structure of a relational database. Because this non-relational database architecture doesn't really need a structure, it can quickly handle massive, often unorganized data sets.

Difference between Cassandra and RDBMS :-

Since, both the databases uses table like format to store data, but the key differences in both of them is :-

Cassandra has no Foreign Key constraint, i.e., we cannot link two tables together.
Cassandra has no Joins.
