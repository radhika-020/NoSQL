NoSQL means Not Only SQL, which uses other languages as well along with SQL.

Types of NoSQL :
1. Key Value [X] -Famous implementation of Key-value is redis.
2. Document Database [X] -mongoDB
3. Tabular [X] -Cassandra
4. Graph - Coming Soon! -neo4j

Why NoSQL is needed?
NoSQL databases store data in a single data format, including a JSON document, rather than the traditional table structure of a relational database. Because this non-relational database architecture doesn't really need a structure, it can quickly handle massive, often unorganized data sets.
