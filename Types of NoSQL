NoSQL means Not Only SQL, which uses other languages as well along with SQL.

Types of NoSQL :
1. Key Value [X] -Famous implementation of Key-value is redis.
2. Document Database [X] -mongoDB
3. Tabular [X] -Cassandra, Open Source database in which anyone can contribute and was built by Facebook and is mainly used by the same.
4. Graph - Coming Soon! -neo4j

Why NoSQL is needed?
NoSQL databases store data in a single data format, including a JSON document, rather than the traditional table structure of a relational database. Because this non-relational database architecture doesn't really need a structure, it can quickly handle massive, often unorganized data sets.

Difference between Cassandra and RDBMS :-

Since, both the databases uses table like format to store data, but the key differences in both of them is :-

Cassandra has no Foreign Key constraint, i.e., we cannot link two tables together.
Cassandra has no Joins.
In Cassandra, there occurs no error when we trying to update an id which is not already present. Infact, it will create a new row with the given values and a unique id and the not provided values will be set to null by default.
Also, when we try to insert a row with the same id which is already been used(if the id is the primary key), SQL will throw an error, but in CQL, no error will be thrown and it will either work not as an insert query but an upsert query. It will update the row that already contains the same id.

In Cassandra, in place of varchar or char, text datatype is used in the case of strings.

Integer can have following types :-
int - 32 bits
bigint - 64 bits
smallint - 16 bits
tinyint - 8 bits

Floating type numbers can have following types :-
float - 32 bits
double - 64 bits

Timestamp can be used to store both date and time. But in case, you only want to enter date, use date and if you want to enter time, use time.
